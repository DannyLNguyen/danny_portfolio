                        <p id="experience_intro">Being in the marketing/sales industry for over 18 years I have finally decided it was time to freshen things up. After discovering my passion for web development, I couldn’t get enough. In order to shorten the learning curve I decided to take the leap and study with Coding Dojo(a full stack web dev bootcamp) I worked on project websites for friends and family, and hired myself to create an eCommerce site for my side business. I’m looking forward to bringing that passion and bridging my experience with my exciting new career path to a full-time role.  </p></br>

                                                <p>As head of recruitment I was in charge of networking and managing J1 agencies not only in the U.S. but around the globe. Utlilizing resoures such as social media platforms as well as holding mixers and conferences to present new and current programs. In the midst of recruitment, daily house cleaning duites were trouble shooting and managing issues for the current or potential students and employees.

                                                <p> The role of a Sr.Loan Officer is very involved in the day to day loan process. After initially the relationship, being a call or email away helped answering any questions or addressing any concerns along the way. Email is the primary source of communication other than the phone itself, naturally I grew quite comfortable around computers and the tech involved. Having to learn and opporate new programs was a routine and key in my success.  </p>

                                                <p>  During my time here I was able to increase sales and most importantly maintain the volume. Among all of the other duties required, I also installed and serviced both the lottery machine and the POS system. Every holiday season, I would organize a toy drive which became an annual tradition. The last year of the drive we were able to create partnerships with manufacturers and ended up with over 50,000 toys donated!  </p>

                                                <p>Creating a business from ground up is never an easy task. It was a challenge not only did I take head on but it was also an environment I thrived in. Being a fully functional screenprinting shop required knowledge of programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop in order to design or render client artwork in order to print. Taking short classes provided by Ryonet and local supply stores helped me navigate my otherwise self taught journey.</p>
